# Add a command line interface for encryption and decryption. You should 
# create a Runner file called encrypt.rb that takes two command line arguments.
# The first is an existing file that contains a message to encrypt. The
# second is a file where your program should write the encrypted message.
# In addition to writing the encrypted message to the file, your program
# should output to the screen the file it wrote to, the key and the date.
